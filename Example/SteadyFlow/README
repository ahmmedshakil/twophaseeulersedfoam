This is an example case for 1DV validation of sand transport under steady channel flow condition with shileds parameter = 1.10 in Sumer et al. (1996)

1. The flow condition (pressure gradient) and sediment properties are descirbed in constant/transportProperties.

2. Parameters and coefficients associated with kinetic theory and frictional stress model are defined in constant/kineticTheoryProperties

3. Numerical Schemes (temporal and spatial schemes) are described in system/fvSchemes

4. The steady pressure gradient has been drving the flow to about 30 sec to reach the steady state, and our numerical data are collected in data/Sumer1996_num.mat, which is a MATLAB file.
