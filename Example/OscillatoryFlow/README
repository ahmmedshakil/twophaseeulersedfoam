This is an example case for 1DV and 2DV validation of sinusoidal (T=5 sec) flow condition with medium sand in O'Donoghue and Wright (2004)

1. The flow condition (pressure gradient) and sediment properties are descirbed in constant/transportProperties.

2. Parameters and coefficients associated with kinetic theory and frictional stress model are defined in constant/kineticTheoryProperties

3. Numerical Schemes (temporal and spatial schemes) are described in system/fvSchemes

4. The flow is driven to about 5 periods to reach the quasi-steady state, and our numerical data are collected in data/OD2004_num.mat, which is a MATLAB file.
